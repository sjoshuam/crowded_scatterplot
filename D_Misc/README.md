# Crowded Scatterplot

This project contains various functions for rendering crowded scatterplots, using only functions available in out-of-the-box R.

1.  **LumpedPoints.R:** Uses k-means clustering to lump points into clusters and then renders circles proportional to the number of points in each cluster.

2.  **SpacedPoints.R:** Spreads out labeled points so that they do not overlap.
